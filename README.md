# Yebe

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/yebe?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yebe)

Yebe provides a collection of well-typed, practical utility functions designed to streamline common tasks and complex interactions when building bots with [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/). Focus on your bot's unique features, let Yebe handle the boilerplate.

## Installation

```bash
# Using npm
npm install yebe discord.js

# Using yarn
yarn add yebe discord.js
```

> **Note:** `discord.js` is a peer dependency and must be installed alongside `yebe`.

## Getting Started

Here's a quick example:

```typescript
import { Client, GatewayIntentBits } from 'discord.js';
import { isSafeChannel, awaitUserInput } from 'yebe';

const client = new Client({
  intents: [
    GatewayIntentBits.Guilds,
    GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages,
    GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent
  ]
});

client.on('messageCreate', async (message) => {
  const { channel, author } = message;

  if (message.content === '!poll' && isSafeChannel(channel)) {
    await channel.send('Whatâ€™s your favorite color?');

    const reply = await awaitUserInput(channel, author);
    if (reply) {
      await channel.send(`You said: ${reply.content}`);
    } else {
      await channel.send('No answer received.');
    }
  }
});

client.login('your-bot-token');

```

This example demonstrates `isSafeChannel` (a type-safe channel guard) and `awaitUserInput`, which collects a message reply from a user.
